# The Elasticity of Price: Mean Reversion 📉

> *"What goes up must come down... eventually."*

## The Concept
Markets are manic-depressive. Prices often overextend due to fear or greed, only to snap back to a statistical equilibrium. This project visualizes **Bollinger Bands** as the "elastic limits" of price action. When price pierces the outer bands, the probability of a reversal increases.

## The Visuals
- **`mean_reversion.gif`**: A cinematic time-lapse showing the price dancing between the bands.
- **`mean_reversion_static.png`**: A high-resolution snapshot of the trade signals.

## Execute
```bash
python3 main.py
```
