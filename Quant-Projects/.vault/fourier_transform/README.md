# The Music of the Markets: Fourier Analysis 🎼

> *"Everything is a wave."*

## The Concept
Financial time series look like noise, but they are often composed of overlapping cycles—daily, weekly, quarterly. Using the **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**, we decompose the chaotic price action into pure sine waves (frequencies). By filtering out high-frequency noise, we can reconstruct the underlying "signal" or trend.

## The Visuals
