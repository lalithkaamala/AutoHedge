# The Heartbeat of Fear: Implied Volatility Surface 💓

> *"Fear has a geometry."*

## The Concept
Traders price options based on **Implied Volatility (IV)**. This IV varies by Strike Price (Skew) and Time to Expiry (Term Structure). Together, they form a 3D surface. In times of panic, this surface "pumps" upwards.

## The Visuals
- **`volatility_surface.gif`**: A mesmerizing 3D wireframe that pulsates and breathes, simulating the changing stress levels of the market.
- **`volatility_static.png`**: The frozen geometry of market sentiment.

## Execute
```bash
python3 main.py
```
