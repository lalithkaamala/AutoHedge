# The Search for Alpha: Efficient Frontier 🏹

> *"Don't put all your eggs in one basket."*

## The Concept
Modern Portfolio Theory (Markowitz). By combining assets that are not perfectly correlated, we can reduce risk without sacrificing return. We simulate thousands of random portfolios to find the **Efficient Frontier**—the mathematical limit of the best possible risk-adjusted returns.

## The Visuals
