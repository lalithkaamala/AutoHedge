# 📅 The Polymath's Social Media Schedule

Here are the pre-written LinkedIn posts corresponding to your automated releases. When the GitHub Action releases a project (every 3 days), copy the **GIF** from the repo and paste the corresponding **Text** into LinkedIn.

## 🚀 Day 0: The Launch (Manual)
**Visual**: `monte_carlo_cinematic.gif` or `gamma_surface_cinematic.gif`
**Text**:
> "Randomness is not chaos; it has a shape." 🌌
>
> I’ve started a new series of experiments: **Financial Physics**.
> Over the next few weeks, I’ll be releasing code that visualizes the mathematical engines behind modern markets—from Monte Carlo simulations to Stochastic Volatility.
>
> First up: The **Black-Scholes Gamma Surface**.
> Instead of a static formula, I built a 3D engine to visualize how "Risk" (Gamma) explodes as an option nears expiration.
>
> The goal? To stop looking at numbers and start seeing the geometry of the market.
>
> 💻 Code is live on GitHub (Link in comments).

## 🗓️ Release 1: Mean Reversion (Day 3)
**Visual**: `Quant-Projects/mean_reversion/mean_reversion.gif`
**Text**:
> Does the market have memory? Or is it just a drunkard's walk? 📉
>
> My latest project visualizes **Mean Reversion**. Using Bollinger Bands as "elastic limits," we can see how price action stretches and snaps back.
>
> When the price pierces the outer bands (2 Standard Deviations), the probability of a reversal spikes. It's not magic; it's just the statistical exhaustion of momentum.
>
> 🐍 Built with Python & Matplotlib.

## 🗓️ Release 2: Fourier Transform (Day 6)
**Visual**: `Quant-Projects/fourier_transform/fourier_cycles.gif`
**Text**:
> Everything is a wave. Even the S&P 500. 🎼
>
> I applied the **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** to market data to decommission the "noise" and find the hidden "frequencies" (cycles) driving the trend.
>
> By filtering out high-frequency static, we can reconstruct the underlying signal. It’s like noise-canceling headphones, but for stock prices.

## 🗓️ Release 3: Fractal Analysis (Day 9)
**Visual**: `Quant-Projects/fractal_analysis/fractal_hurst.png`
**Text**:
> How "rough" is the market today? ❄️
>
> Benoit Mandelbrot famously argued that markets aren't smooth "Normal Distributions"—they are **Fractals**.
>
> In this project, I calculate the **Hurst Exponent (H)** to measure the "roughness" of the time series:
> • H > 0.5: Trending (Persistent)
> • H < 0.5: Mean Reverting (Choppy)
>
> It’s a literal measure of the market's chaos level.

## 🗓️ Release 4: Heston Model (Day 12)
**Visual**: `Quant-Projects/heston_model/heston_3d.gif`
**Text**:
> Volatility isn't a constant number. It's a living, breathing storm. 🌪️
>
> The Black-Scholes model assumes volatility is constant. The **Heston Model** knows better.
>
> I built a 3D stochastic simulation where Price (Z-axis) and Volatility (Y-axis) dance together. You can literally see the "Fat Tails"—the black swan events that standard models fail to predict.
>
> This is what real market risk looks like.

## 🗓️ Release 5: Efficient Frontier (Day 15)
**Visual**: `Quant-Projects/efficient_frontier/efficient_frontier.gif`
**Text**:
> Searching for the perfect portfolio. 🏹
>
> I simulated 2,000 random portfolios to map the **Efficient Frontier**.
>
> The Animation shows the "Bullet" taking shape—the mathematical boundary where you get the maximum return for the minimum risk. Every dot is a possible future; the edge is where you want to live.

## 🗓️ Release 6: Pairs Trading (Day 18)
**Visual**: `Quant-Projects/pairs_trading/pairs_trading.gif`
**Text**:
> Finding the invisible tether between assets. ⚖️
>
> Coke & Pepsi. Gold & Silver. Some assets are statistically married.
>
> This project uses the **Engle-Granger Cointegration Test** to find pairs that move together. When they drift apart (the Z-Score spread widens), we can bet on the "snap back."
>
> It’s classic Statistical Arbitrage visualized.
>

## 🗓️ Release 7: Volatility Surface (Day 21)
**Visual**: `Quant-Projects/volatility_surface/volatility_surface.gif`
**Text**:
> The Heartbeat of Fear. 💓
>
> Traders don't just trade price; they trade "Implied Volatility."
>
> This 3D visualization shows the **Volatility Surface**—the landscape of market fear across different strikes and expirations.
>
> Watch it pulse. That's the market breathing. When it spikes, panic is setting in. When it flattens, complacency takes over.
